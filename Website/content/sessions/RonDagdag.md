Introductory and Overview

### Description

Have you ever wanted to make your apps “smarter”? This session will cover what every ML/AI developer should know about Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) . Why it’s important and how it can reduce friction in incorporating machine learning models to your apps. We will show how to train models using ML.NET, save or convert models into ONNX, and deploy to cloud and edge using a high-performance runtime.
