### Speaker Bio

Hello! My name is Luis. I'm a Microsoft MVP in Developer Technologies and AI. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Engineering Informatics at Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic.

I am a fan of software development, particularly mobile apps with Xamarin integrated with cloud computing services, such as Azure. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence is amazing and one of my favorite topics!

I've been developing .NET apps for more than 10 years. I find C# a really powerful language which allow us to create different kinds of software.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, either at writing a blog post or streaming an online session. Of course, activities such as talking for a conference and answering peeps' questions in social networks are included as well.
