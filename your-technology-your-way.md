Your Technology Your Way: Full-stack Web and Service with .NET and Node
=======================================================================

Do you want to build full-stack with your stack? We'll build an ASP.NET website using Blazor and WebAPI, a back-end service using Service Worker and gRPC -- all new in .NET Core 3. Then we'll build the same website with Node using Express, Vue.js, gRPC, and PM2. Along the way we'll compare and contrast these technologies to empower you to use JavaScript or C# front-to-back for your next project. You'll leave with a functional sample in each, and a methodology to choose your next full-stack site.
