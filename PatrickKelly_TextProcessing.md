# Text Processing is Really Complicated

## Short Abstract

We aren't in the days of ASCII anymore. UNICODE introduces all sorts of terminology and complexities: code units, scalar values, normalization forms, extended grapheme clusters... There's a lot of complexity, and a lot of bad algorithms out there breaking software for many of the people around the world. But it doesn't have to be that way. There's things being done to make this all easier.

## Video Abstract

While not exactly, I would be covering a very similar idea to [this article](https://entomy.github.io/articles/text-manipulation-is-complicated.html). The video will cover additional API's from Microsoft, such as `Rune`, as well as stuff from one of my own projects. The focus will be on explaining current solutions to addressing the complexity, but will show some examples of common pitfalls and the far reaching implications naive algorithms can have.
