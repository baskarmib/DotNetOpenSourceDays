# Stand back; I'm Going to Try Scientist!

## Short Abstract

No matter how much we test our code, end users will always do things differently. This leads to user and data-specific bugs, frustration, and long hours spent diagnosing and debugging production issues. There's got to be a better way. Scientist may be the answer.

In this session we'll explore canary testing with Scientist .NET and see how Scientist allows us to broadly test changes without risking user-facing defects while giving developers the time and confidence to safely improve their code.

While Scientist is available in many languages, we'll specifically be exploring Scientist .NET and using it to work with synchronous and asynchronous tests.
