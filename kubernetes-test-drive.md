Kubernetes Test Drive
=====================

Are you a Docker aficionado or are you new to the Docker ecosystem? Come see how Kubernetes (K8s) adds a mature solution for running containers in production and development. We'll start with containers, layer in pods, replica sets, deployments, and services. We'll dig into minikube and kubernetes in docker desktop. You'll leave with a solid understanding of the principles of K8s, and a practical set of skills for driving this container orchestrator throughout the software development lifecycle.
